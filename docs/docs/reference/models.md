# Models

Models created by re_data.

### re_data_tables
Information about all monitored tables. This is currently only table which is supposed to be edited (you can think of it as a configuration table) 
2 columns can be changed there:
- Change `actively_monitored` to `true`/`false` to start/stop monitoring table and computing stats for it, `(default: false)`
- Change `time_filter` to name of column you would like to use as time filter
Time filter is important thing in `re_data`, it's used in all filters computing metrics (to filter records added in a given day)
On the start some educated guess ðŸ™‚ is assigned as this field, but quite often it may require to be changed. `(default: first timestamp type column)`


### re_data_columns
Information about all monitored columns, this contains information about columns similar to this
what you can find in `information_schema`. This table is not supposed to be edited and new columns will be added and old removed
in case of schema changes for your tables.

### re_data_freshness
Information about time (in seconds) since last data was added to each table. `time_filter` column is used to find about
time the record was added. If `time_filter` column is updated (with new time), update time will also be taken into account.

:::info
`re_data` uses only `re_data:time_window_end` when computing this model.

You can thing about this as freshness is computed in `re_data:time_window_end` point in time. 
This enables you to backfill freshness to for the past data (assuming you will can re_data with different `re_data:time_window_end` parameters)

:::

### re_data_row_count
Numbers of rows added to table in specific time range.

### re_data_count_nulls
Number of nulls in a given column for specific time range.

### re_data_count_missing
Number of nulls and empty string values in a given column for specific time range.

### re_data_min
Minimal value appearing in a given column for specific time range.

### re_data_max
Maximal value appearing in a given column for specific time range.

### re_data_avg
Average of all values appearing in a given column for specific time range.

### re_data_min_length
Minimal length of all strings appearing in a given column for specific time range.

### re_data_max_length
Maximal length of all strings appearing in a given column for specific time range.

### re_data_avg_length
Average length of all strings appearing in a given column for specific time range.

### re_data_base_metrics
Internal table containing most of described metrics (apart from `re_data_freshness`). To really access
metrics it's usually better to use view for specific metric.

### re_data_columns_over_time
This contains all columns together with their types (tables schema), computed for all `re_data` runs.

### re_data_schema_changes

All schema changes in `actively_monitored` tables in period monitored by `re_data.` 
re_data compares schemas from most recent snapshots of column types (computed in `re_data_columns_over_time`), and if there are
any differences, it adds information about them to this table.

:::info

`re_data` doesn't use `re_data:time_window_end` and `re_data:time_window_start` when computing this model.

As schema data is only available for current schema. All schema changes found will be from period when re_data is used for monitoring.

:::

### re_data_z_score
Computed z_score for metric. `re_data` looks back on what where metrics values in last 30 days and compute z_score for newest value.

### re_data_alerting
View computed on top of `re_data_z_score` table to contain metrics which look alerting. Alerting threshold is controled by var `re_data:alerting_z_score`
which is equal to 3 by default, but can be changed and adjusted.
